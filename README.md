## What is it?

*Slide Gazer* is a web application that can be used to present slide-shows written as markdown documents.

## Features

* Use any text-editor to create slide-show presentations and do it quickly by focussing only on content and not formatting
* Present from any computer, phone or tablet: all you need is a web-browser
* Choose from a range of slide-transition animations
* Select auto-transition of slides
* Control the presentation from another device and have a bird's eye view of the presentation at the same time

## How to use

Open the URL [http://slide-gazer.teamfluxion.com](http://slide-gazer.teamfluxion.com) in a web-browser.

Choose to present a slide-show presentation or to control one that is already running.

### Presenting a slide-show

You can select a presentation to be presented in one of the following three ways:

1. Pick a markdown document from the system
2. Drop a markdown document on the page
3. Reload a previously presented slide-show

Once a presentation is started, navigate through the slides using the right and left arrow keys on the keyboard.

Hover on the top-menu to reveal more options like animations and slide auto-transition.

### Controlling a slide-show

While a presentation is being presented, expand the top-menu to view the URL that can be used to control the presentation from another device.

You can also scan the QR code to navigate to the URL.

Once a connection to the presentation if estabilished, use the buttons on the controller to control the presentation.
